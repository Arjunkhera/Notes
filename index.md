### About 

This repository contains notes and links to resources which I have found to be of useful. Most of the information present
here is related technology in general and computer science in specific.  

Personally for me, this serves as a binder to review stuff. The purpose is to be able to reflect back on the challenges faced, 
mistakes made and the solutions that were found. The contained notes are not supposed to act as a tutorial, but only
to be used as references. The reason being that there are already a large number of resources available out there 
having an impeccable quality.  

Majority of the information you are going to find here will be roadblocks faced while developing or general issues 
and how other people have solved them. Most of the time, as a developer, one comes across a plethora of new
ways of doing stuff, or beautiful solutions to both challenging as well mundane problems. I intend to keep these 
gems curated here for myself to reflect lest I shall face a similar situation in the future. I hope that others also 
shall benefit from this as much, given that many of the troubles faced in development are similar 
in nature.  

There are also going to be some basic notes that I will make when I am learning something new, like a language
or a tool. However, as explained above, the intent is to write only the basics and provides links to resources on the web.
So in case, in future if I need to brush up anything, I can refer to these notes and links.

Lastly, for the time being, there will also be some articles that I will post. The aim is to share experiences rather than
raw information, which is basically available everywhere, one has to only google. I will try to provide some backstory 
alongwith the problems and solutions. Here's hoping it might help someone.   

The notes here are maintained using VimWiki, something I have found to be extremely powerful. You can find the details of the 
setup in the blog.
