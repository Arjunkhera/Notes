# Hi

I am Arjun Khera. And you have stumbled upon my public personal space. 

**10 Second Intro**
Software Developer working in Adobe who likes reading, playing games, listening to music and learning new things.
And of course sharing things, as you can guess by the plethora of links you are going to find below.

If I caught your attention, you can get to know me better by heading to [About Me](about.md)

**How do I find my way around this site ?**
This is a mix of personal things I love to share and a vast of collection of notes. First section is about my stuff,
that is blogs, and things I love to curate. Second section is a binder collection of my notes on various things, mostly programming. 

**[Blog](/blog/main.md)** : Yes, another blog you might say. Well take your chances, for you are going to find here a rundown of my ramblings, which includes
nearly everything under the sun from embarassing mistakes, heartbreaks, failures, hard lessions, take on philosophy, rants on 
anything that interests me and of course etcetra, you are more than welcome to read my blog. Go on, give it a try, who knows you 
might actually find something useful.


**[GoodReads](/goodReads/main.md)** : I read a lot of articles. And there is a plethora of really good content out there. GoodReads is a list of articles that 
I would absolutely recommend reading.

## Personal Knowledge Base
Yes. That's right. It took my 23 years exactly to realise that I was learning stuff the wrong way. I cannot speak 
for others, but most of my life was spent rote learning, because, well that is exactly how the curriculum was here
in India during my time. I do not blame anyone, and this is not a rant. 

Long story short, check out the [Feynman technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), it is a fascinating take on how to approach learning effectively.
Since then, I have been on a mission to revisit a lot of topics in mathematics, science and computer science. While 
on this journey, I have and will continue facing issues and solutions, amongst things that broaden my horizon and 
enlighten me. 

This personal knowledge base is an attempt to keep a track of the same and share it with others at the same time. 
Most of the stuff you find here is going to be related to programming because thats what I do for a living.
