1. Plugin manager 
   
   I prefer to use Vundle, as it provides most of the facilities. 
   Check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/49uag0/vundle_vs_pathogen_vs/)
   
   An important point to note : Pathogen is not, technically, a plugin manager. It's sole purpose is to add specific user-defined directories to the runtimepath option used by Vim to know where to look for scripts. Any "plugin management" is entirely left to the user.
   Vundle, neobundle, VAM, plugâ€¦ are all actual "plugin managers" because they give you the ability to find/install/remove/update plugins all from within Vim.
   So, if some plugin reads install using Pathogen, it means you can install using Vundle also. 
   Here is another take on the [vim and pathogen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29971431/how-to-use-pathogen-and-vundle-at-the-same-time-with-vim)
