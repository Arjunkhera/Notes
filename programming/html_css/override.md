## Overriding Css Style Elements

In css we can override style elements. 

1. Nested elements can be override the styles of their parents.
2. If a nested element has multiple declarations, then the last css styling is accepted.
3. id overrides class
4. inline overrides anyother styling.
5. !important is the at the top and can override anything, even inline styling. It is usually used when are using third party css sheets and want to be absolutely sure that our style is not overridden.
