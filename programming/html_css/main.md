**Note**

I should be the last authority on earth when it comes to consulting notes 
and resources for front end. These are rags of notes that I made while 
trying my hand at frontend from FreeCodeCamp, which is by the way a really
great site to get your hands on learning frontend stuff. Though, if in case
in future I try my hand at frontend, I will organise these in a much better 
way, ensuring only the important stuff is kept.
