## Environment and Packages

### Development Environment

Setting Up 

I prefer using Vim. The primary reason being that byobu allows to switch between multiple windows very quickly making the process of 
writing code and subsequently compiling and running a breeze, without switching tabs between applications. Everything runs from the 
terminal. Although, using plugins is not required, in fact not all encouraged when the scope of code is small. However, for increased
workloads, installing a few plugins can go a long way. Visit [this](https://labs.signalsciences.com/setup-vim-for-golang-development) for details.  

Personally, I have just installed the vim-go plugin and it really makes writing and doing stuff a breeze, and if you can support, 
do visit his patreon page.
