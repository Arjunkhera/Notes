## Arrays

### 1. Arrays in javascript are quite similar to lists in python.

```javascript

// we can have variable number of columns, and the contents can also vary
arr = [[23,45]["arjun"]];

// unlike strings we can modify the arrays through indexing
arr[0][0] = 21 // changes 23 to 21

```

### 2. Arrays support insertion and deletion both at front and the end

- push inserts at the end
- unshit inserts at the front
- pop removes the last element
- shift removes the first element
