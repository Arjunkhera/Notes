## Static and Dynamic Binding

1. An object in Java that passes more than one IS-A tests is polymorphic in nature
2. Every object in Java passes a minimum of two IS-A tests: one for itself and one for Object class
3. Static polymorphism in Java is achieved by method overloading
4. Dynamic polymorphism in Java is achieved by method overriding
5. Static binding in Java occurs during Compile time while Dynamic binding occurs during Runtime.
6. Private, final and static methods and variables uses static binding and bonded by compiler while virtual methods are bonded during runtime based upon runtime object.
7. Static binding uses Type(Class in Java)  information for binding while Dynamic binding uses Object to resolve binding.
