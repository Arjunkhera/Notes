## Equals and ==

1. "==" operator compares the values inside the provided objects. 
2. For primitives this corresponds to the value they hold.
3. For objects, this corresponds to the addresses that they point to.
4. In order to compare two objects we can use the equals method provided in the object class.
5. The defualt implementation of equals is same as "=="
6. One can override equals in their class and compare two objects as per their specifications
7. Also, you have to cast the object parameter into a type of your class before comparing
