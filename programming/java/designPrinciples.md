## SOLID principles

1. Single responsibility
	Just do one thing only
2. Open Close Prinicple ( OCP )
	Made once, but accepts anything falling in the criteria or is comparable. It should be extensible
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
	Any special function or object should be perfectly capable of performing all the functionality included in the general class.   
    That is it should inherit all the functionality at the least, and then can add over it
4. Interface Segregation
	All functionalities should be separate for separate views. For example, a customer has a different view from a manager in a banking 
	application
5. Dependency Injection
	Providing inputs and other stuff is out responsibility. The object does not concern itself with that.
