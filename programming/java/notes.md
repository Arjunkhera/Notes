# Everything

- A single java file can contain more than one class
- We can make immutable objects, fancy way of saying values are final and cannot be changed once assigned. A good example is String class from java.lang
- Use of toString for classes can lead to stack overflow if their is circular reference. Be carefu about using classes in toString or remove toString from one of the classes being referenced.

## Access Modifiers

**Class**

- Public : accessible by any class, same package or not
- Package Private(default, no explicit modifier) : visible only to classes in the same package
 
 
**Fields and Methods**

| Modifier  | Class | Package | SubClass | Global |
|-----------|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| Public    | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | Yes    |
| Protected | Yes   | Yes     | Yes      | No     |
| Default   | Yes   | Yes     | No       | No     |
| Private   | Yes   | No      | No       | No     |


## Inheritance

- If you do not want a class to be inherited, use the final keyword
- Standard classes such as Integer, Long, String cannot be extended
- Superclass aka base, parent
- Subclass aka child, extended, derived
- Note, if you declare a parameterised constructor, then java does not provide a default constructor. Hence don't forget to declare a default constructor in parent alongside if you intent to use in the child class

## Overriding 

- The method must have the same name as in the superclass
- The arguments should be exactly the same as in the superclass method
- The return type should be the same type or a subtype of the return type declared in the method of the superclass
- The access level must be the same or more open than the overridden method's access level
- A private method cannot be overridden because it's not inherited by subclasses
- If the superclass and its subclass are in the same package, then package-private methods can be overridden
- Static methods cannot be overridden
- To prevent overriding, either use static or final
- the signature of static method and other methods in parent and child classes should never match
- do read this [stack overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12818082/5131614)
- the return type for overriding can only differ when the return type of base is either same or a derived class of the base

## SuperClass Reference

- You can cast a super class to a sub class only in the scenario where th object initially created was of the sub class.
When to use super class reference 
1. Processing an array (or another collection) of objects which have different types from the same hierarchy
2. A method that accepts an object of the base class, but can also work with objects of its subclasses



## Packages

- Best practise is to start in small case for naming packages
- Package and import statements are optional
- In order to use static imports, write static after import
- In order to import all files in a package, use import package.path.*
- Avoid importing all files until unless required
- You can directly invoke static classes and memebers of a class using without any prefix by using * in front of import name


**Default Package**
- If you do not provide any package name for your file, it is put in the default package
- The default package classes cannot be imported in other packages, thus making it extremely disadvantageous


## Constructors

- Default constructor is automatically generated by the compiler
- However, if you provide an instance of any type of constructor. The default constructor will not be generated
- If you call another constructor from a constructor, the call should be the first line of execution in the body of the calling constructor

## Annotations

- Java has only three built in general purpose annotations
    - @Deprecated
    - @SupressWarnings
    - @Override
- Some annotations require you to specify default values

## Initialisation Blocks

- Always executed before the constructor
- Static initialisation blocks can only access the static fields and methods
- They are after field initliasation
- Order of execution of blocks is according to the order in which they are written
- Static initialisation blocks are always executed before any other execution blocks
- Static initialisation block is only invoked once, whenever the first object created using new

## Super

- Can be used to access fields, methods or constructors of parent class
- Invoking super should be the first line in base class constructor 
- In case of default constructor, java automatically invokes the parent class constructor
  
  
## Polymorphism

Broadly classified as either of the two forms
1. Static(Compile Time) : achieved using method overloading 
2. Dynamic(Run Time) : achieved using method overriding 

Other Theoretical definitions include
1. Ad Hoc Polymorphism : same as method overloading
2. Subtype Polymorphism aka subtyping : possibility to use an instance of the subclass when an instance of the base is permitted
3. Parametric Polymorphism : same as generic programming

In runtime polymorphism(subtyping/overriding) the result of a method call depends on the actual type of the instance, not the reference type
  

## The Object class

- The object class is the parent of any class in java by default
- It has the following nine methods

1. **thread synchronisation** : wait, notify, notifyAll
2. **object identity** : hashCode, equals
3. **object management** : finalize, clone, getClass
4. **human readable representation** : toString

Some of the above methods are native, that means typically written in C or C++. Native methods are used to interface with system calls or libraries written in other programming languages

## Abstract Classes

- Can have fields and methods(static or not)
- Abstract methods do not have any implementations
- Static methods cannot be declared abstract
- You cannot create instances of abstract class
- It can extend any other class, abstract or not
- And it can contain constructors

## Interface

An interface is a special class that cannot be instantiated. It can contain
1. Public constants. You do not need to use public static final, that is automatically applied.
2. Abstract methods (abstract keyword is not required here)
3. Default methods with implementation. They can be overridden in sub classes.
4. Static methods with implementation

If modifiers are not specified, the method is assumed to be public abstract

An interface cannot contain
1. Fields
2. Constructors
3. Non public abstract methods

**Marker Interfaces**
- have an empty body
- They are used to provide important information to the JVM

- Interfaces support multiple inheritences
- An interface can only extend another interface

**Some differences between abstract and interface**

- An abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract instance methods while an interface can have abstract or default instance methods
- An abstract class can extend another abstract or regular class and an interface can only extend another interface
- An abstract class can extend only one class while an interface can extend any number of interfaces
- An abstract class can have final, non-final, static, non-static variables (regular fields) while an interface can only have static final variables
- An abstract class can provide an implementation of an interface but an interface cannot provide an implementation of an abstract class
- An abstract class can have a constructor and an interface cannot
- In an abstract class, the keyword abstract is mandatory to declare a method as an abstract one while in an interface this keyword is optional


## Q/A

1. What is a JAR file ?
    - Just a zip file usually containing .class files. Check [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12079230/what-exactly-does-a-jar-file-contain) for more details

2. Stuff about environment variables, classpath and related stuff
