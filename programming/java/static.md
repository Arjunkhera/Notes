## Static

1. Declaring something static moves it from the heap to the metadata area
2. A static variable or block is attached to the class instead of the object, that is it becomes a class variable instead of an instance variable
3. This is useful when you want some logic to be executed without requiring objects
4. Or in cases where you are passing two objects to a class method, static kind of enusers fairness, as no one object calls the method.
