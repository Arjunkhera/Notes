## Acronyms

### Java Virtual Machine(JVM)
JVM is a virtual simulation of a physical computer. It executes compiled Java programs that consist of bytecode instructions. JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms, which makes Java programs platform independent, because a program can run on any JVM.

Today there is a variety of JVM implementations. For instance, HotSpot is the primary reference Java VM implementation.

### Java Runtime Environment(JRE)
JRE is an execution environment for running (but not developing) Java programs. JRE includes Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and Java Class Library (JCL).

JCL consists of many libraries including input/output, collections, security, classes for parsing XML, user interface toolkits, and many others.

If you only want to run a Java program, JRE is enough for you.

### Java Development Kit(JDK)
JDK is a package to run and develop Java programs. It includes JRE and tools for developers, such as Java compiler, debugger, archiver, etc.

Java compiler (usually it's the javacï»¿ tool) translates *.java into *.class. Several files with *.class extension can be packed together in a single Java Archive (JAR-file).

As a developer, you need to install JDK to develop your programs.

To recap, remember these abbreviations:

1. JVM executes compiled Java programs;
2. JRE includes JVM and standard libraries: it is needed to run Java programs;
3. JDK includes JRE and development tools: it is needed to develop Java programs.
