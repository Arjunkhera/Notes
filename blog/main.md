# Blog

The nature to write something can be spontaneous or planned. In light of this, I have divided my articles in two 
categories, namely **General** and **Series**. As you can probably make out by now, articles written without any 
established context can be found in General. However, if you enjoy reading articles that are written for a 
specific Series, you can straightaway reference them.

### General

For programming related articles : [programming](/blog/programming/main.md)

And for anything apart from that : [everything else](/blog/everythingElse/main.md)

### Series
